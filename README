DroidCouch is a minimal Android library for using CouchDB, licensed under the MIT license.

Our intention is to make a small Java library well suited for Android mobile development. 

DroidCouch was inpired by Divan (github.com/foretagsplatsen/Divan), a C# library with a more or less complete CouchDB API. Initiated by Jonas Beckman, DroidCouch was originally developed in-house at MSC Konsult AB.
